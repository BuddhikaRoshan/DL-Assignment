4th year DL Assignment# ðŸ©º Cancer Image Classification using CNN

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **SE4050 â€“ Deep Learning (July 2025)** module.  
The goal of this part is to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model capable of classifying medical images as either **cancerous** or **non-cancerous** based on a real-world dataset.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To apply deep learning techniques to a medical image dataset and develop a model that can assist in detecting cancer from microscopic images with high accuracy.

## ðŸ§© Dataset
- **Dataset Source:** 

- Each image is resized and preprocessed before being fed into the CNN model.
